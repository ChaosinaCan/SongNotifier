SongNotifier is an Opera extension that displays notifications when a new song
plays in Internet radio services. It currently works with:

- Google Music
- Grooveshark
- iHeartRadio
- Jamendo
- Pandora
- Rdio
- RadioParadise
- VK

It is usually simple to add support for another service provided that it is does
not exist entirely within a plugin like Flash. If you would like to see support
for another service, just ask and I'll see if it's possible.
